**Introduction**

All of us have heard of Continuous Integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).\
There are many benefits to implementing CI/CD, as it helps seamless integration from end to end for development and deployment processes.\
DevSecOps is a philosophy that focuses on introducing a culture of security in the DevOps environment. It is a collaboration of the DevOps with cyber security and system security, where the focus is on finding faster and more efficient ways to safely deliver codes in an agile architecture.\
DevSecOps strives to bridge the gaps between IT and security while responding to bottlenecks in the existing environment.

**Key Elements of the DevSecOps Environment**

* Microservice-Based Infrastructure - Single-function modules that contain well-defined interfaces and operations is essential for the success of focused DevSecOps.
* Continuous Feedback Loop - Setting up a continuous feedback loop will help developers and machines get a comprehensive insight into system/platform vulnerability to security threats.
* Focused Automation - In software development life cycle right from the start, can reduce the friction that may occur between development and security teams over software/platform security by quickly addressing existing and potential concerns at the lowest cost.

**Tools I used in this scenario for DevSecOps**

* [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)
* [Spotbugs](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs)
* [OWASP Zap](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy)
* [Wazuh](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh)

Now DevOps will look something like this\

If we see this as a pipeline so each stage is having security integrated with the help of tools\
This can be explained with a diagram below.

Now how to configure these tools in your environment?\
These links below is having steps to configure tools and Explains working too.

* [Configuration of Gitleaks]()
* [Configuration  of Spotbugs]()
* [Configuration  of OWASP Zap]()
* [Configuration  of Wazuh]()

**CONCLUSION -** There are different ways by which you can enable security in DevOps to add value to your project.\
By doing so, you are helping to create a culture of security awareness, which leads to secure applications and improved quality security features.
